# Pig_Latin_MicroService
Listen on port 80 and accept a string that contains at least one word, but potentially entire paragraphs. 
Convert the words in the string to Pig Latin and return the results in the HTTP message body.
Preserve all of the punctuation in the original string.
# Getting Started
Tools: python 2.7 environment and Chrome plugin Postman.
Just run the following command to get up server.
```bash
   python server.py 8080
```
The service will then be listening on port 8080(if port is already allocated, change to other port). If you visit the page http://localhost:8080/, you will see the welcome message.
